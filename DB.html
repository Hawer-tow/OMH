	 As a database system is a fundamental component of the larger organization-wide 
information system, the database system development lifecycle is inherently associ
ated with the lifecycle of the information system. The stages of the database system 
development lifecycle are shown in Figure 10.1. Below the name of each stage is 
the section in this chapter that describes that stage.
 It is important to recognize that the stages of the database system development 
lifecycle are not strictly sequential, but involve some amount of repetition of pre
vious stages through feedback loops. For example, problems encountered during 
database design may necessitate additional requirements collection and analysis. 
As there are feedback loops between most stages, we show only some of the more 
obvious ones in Figure 10.1. A summary of the main activities associated with each 
stage of the database system development lifecycle is described in Table 10.1.
 For small database systems, with a small number of users, the lifecycle need not 
be very complex. However, when designing a medium to large database systems 
with tens to thousands of users, using hundreds of queries and application pro
grams, the lifecycle can become extremely complex. Throughout this chapter, 
we concentrate on activities associated with the development of medium to large 
database systems. In the following sections we describe the main activities associated 
with each stage of the database system development lifecycle in more detail
An important first step in database planning is to clearly define the mission state
ment for the database system. The mission statement defines the major aims of the 
database system. Those driving the database project within the organization (such  
as the Director and/or owner) normally define the mission statement. A mission  
statement helps to clarify the purpose of the database system and provide a clearer 
path towards the efficient and effective creation of the required database system. 
Once the mission statement is defined, the next activity involves identifying the  
mission objectives. Each mission objective should identify a particular task that the 
database system must support. The assumption is that if the database system sup
ports the mission objectives, then the mission statement should be met. The mission 
statement and objectives may be accompanied by some additional information that 
specifies in general terms the work to be done, the resources with which to do it,  
and the money to pay for it all. We demonstrate the creation of a mission statement 
and mission objectives for the database system of DreamHome in Section 11.4.2.
 Database planning should also include the development of standards that gov
ern how data will be collected, how the format should be specified, what docu
mentation will be needed, and how design and implementation should proceed.  
Standards can be very time-consuming to develop and maintain, requiring 
resources to set them up initially, and to continue maintaining them. However, a  
well-designed set of standards provides a basis for training staff and measuring
