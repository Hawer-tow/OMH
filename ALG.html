	A software engineer is designing a routing algorithm for a delivery service that dynamically 
adjusts routes based on real-time traffic conditions. Considering the algorithm's efficiency, 
what is the most appropriate complexity class for an algorithm that needs to evaluate all 
possible delivery routes to find the optimal one in relation to the number of delivery 
points? 
In the search of a solution to the delivery most appropriate root it would be very essential 
to have a clear understanding of the scenario that is witnessed as many delivers are to be 
made. 
It would be essential that the algorithm is able to conduct a clear analysis of the delivery 
points and to be able to assign a route that would best suite the delivery of all the goods by 
use of one root. This is only possible if the algorithm is at its best case and as its common 
this is rarely accomplished. 
On the worst case it would be at its worst delivery if the deliveries are made through none 
common/unrelated routes and the deliveries to be made are to be made through different 
routes. 
On a more complex additive is that it has to consider the traffic conditions and based on 
that it is to evaluate the most alternative method to be used for the deliveries. 
Most efficient complexity class. 
There are key things to note here: 
• Roads have their own respective distinct ids. 
• The roads have various lengths. 
• Roads are interconnected  
It is key to note that the algorithm has to consider a list of delivery points and based on the 
available road connections it provides the most circular route like structure for the based 
deliveries. 
The two main common ways to divide the data given to provide the best delivery route are: 
• Quick sort 
• Merge sort 
In the race to create a kind of a sort to come up with a solution the nearest route to where 
the delivery element is used as pivot in sorting the rest of the routes that are available for 
access. 
Based on the nearest route then the algorithm is able to give the best route for the 
deliveries. 
Since it the deliveries to be made lie at an average area. Hence based on the range of 
delivery points (inputs), it will be able to come up with the best route possible. 
Since this algorithm can be pooled by the factorial complexity case but because of the 
most efficient the solution is left for the sort mechanisms. 
Therefore, the sorting techniques are the most appropriate in telling the delivery best 
routes and their best complexity classes for the best and average case is the log-linear 
complexity class. 
Why the efficiency 
1. It is efficient in algorithm set up. 
2. It requires less time resources as compared to the factorial complexity case that 
use more time to deliver best analysis at the efficient time. 
3. It can be used to both give a best case and an average case
