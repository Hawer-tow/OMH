<p style="text-align:center;"> To software requirement engineering </p>
<pre>
	You are software engineering and apple company has tasked you to design some requirement specifications 
that they can implement in order to ensure swift transition of user's other companies. As a software engineer 
identify some of the functions and non-functional requirements showing clearly on areas of requirements 
implementations 
THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
1) The users should be able to access other companies/machine operating systems with ease. 
2) The additional functionalities to the system should take less memory space. 
3) The system should be able to connect with other companies quickly. 
4) The system should ensure smooth transition of the system from the apple machine structure to other 
structures. 
5) The system should be able to provide the user with easy methodology in the operation of the system 
once it is shifted from the apples system to the other industry systems. 
6) The system should provide easy maintenance structures. 
7) The system should pair with new required hardware devices. 
8) The apples system relational modules should be built in modules depending on the factorial relational 
models. 
9) The apples system should under-go some testing to ensure the systems modules that have been built 
differently are able to integrate. 
10) The apples system should be able to provide an easy-to-use structure for ease of navigation by the 
user. 
11) Apples system should be able to able to maintain the data integrity in case of the system failure of shut 
down. 
12) The system should ensure that un-authorized user data is kept safe from the other companies unless 
under the users consent or through proper authorization. 
THE NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
iv) 
v) 
vi) 
vii) 
The system should be able to liase with only liable/legit enterprises by giving a range of the permitted 
groups of companies that are secure enough to connect and share data with. 
The system should provide the user with an easy-to-use interface that allows the user to interact with 
the various types of companies and the services offered. 
In case of a failure in connecting with another company the system is to take a maximum of 5 minutes 
to restart the system and reconnect with the other system. 
The system should also include a secure database that allows the storage of the already filled processes 
during a connection failure or a cyber threat and upon the restoration of a restarted or a secure 
connection the system should return the user to his/her original position during the process. 
The system should utilize proper algorithms in order to ensure a proper utilization of resources like 
space. The system should use not more than 600Mbs of space. 
The system should be able to conduct a range of 2mbps at its worst case. This is to be achieved 
through utilization of proper data transfer structures that enable transfer of data at satisfactory rate. 
The system is to utilize passwords and very complex login credentials this is to ensure that data that is 
transferred from one system to another is secure of sabotage and access from un-authorized 
personnels. 
etermine and document fully how the system would work better to support the organizational 
needs and to make recommendations to the management. 
The main task is to gather and record facts about the current system and what is required to improve 
the current system. 
To obtain this information, you must ask the right questions and the answers to these questions 
will be used to determine the current condition of the existing system and also improvements 
needed. 
The analysis phase has 3 steps:-  
i) 
ii) 
iii) 
Determine system requirements 
Analysis requirements 
Make decision/evaluate alternatives and strategies.  
i) Determining System Requirements 
For a system to be accepted by the users and the organization requirement is a major feature that 
must be included since it serves as the bench to measure the acceptability of the finished system. 
The analysis phase of software development defines what the system should do rather than how it 
should be developed. 
It starts with data obtained at the data gathering stage using various techniques. 
The result of the different faces of analysis give different requirements. 
Types of requirements are:- 
i)
